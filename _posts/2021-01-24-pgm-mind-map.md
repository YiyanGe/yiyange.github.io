Over the course of several months, I have gone through the key content of the [coursera specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/probabilistic-graphical-models) on Probablistic Graphical Models. However, I am not very happy with the learning outcome in that I still do not have a clear picture of the PGM framework. This is not because the course content is disorganized (in fact, the instructor does a very good job giving a birds-eye view of the course as well as constantly summarizing each concept and explaining why it matters), but mainly that I have been studying this on and off and also that I have also found it difficult to learn new concepts systematically. 

Thus, I decided to use mind map to organize what I have learned. The process of creating this, which is still work-in-progress, has highlighted new connections, revealed gaps, as well as saved rooms for future learning. 

In addition to the course content, this set of [class notes](https://ermongroup.github.io/cs228-notes/) is also helpful in providing another perspective.
