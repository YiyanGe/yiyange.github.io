# Motivation

> Man is condemed to be free. --- Jean-Paul Sartre

&nbsp;


Life is chaotic. I find it fairly easy to lose focus, especially after finishing school. The tendency to feel content with day-to-day work is also alarming. After eight months of doing nothing, I finally set up this page.

This project is essentially a collection of notes on things that I have learned or plan to learn that are related to my professional interests, including transportation planning, data science, and software development. 

But who knows what it will become or fail to become.
